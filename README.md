### Cardiff Go Meetup - Hack Nights

We're hoping to create a single point of reference for all code generated for the meetup - be it examples or the code we write together.

Each night will have a directory. Before the meetup we'll upload any sample code or documentation we're going to need for the hack night within this space.

Throughout the evening (if you wish) you can create subdirectories and upload the code you produce. By all means, include a README and any relevant links.
