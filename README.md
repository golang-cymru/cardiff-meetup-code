### Cardiff Go Meetup - Hack Nights

We're hoping to create a single point of reference for all code generated for the meetup - be it examples or the code we write together.

For topic specific/study group hacks, each night will have a directory. Before the meetup we'll upload any sample code or documentation we're going to need for the hack night within this space.

If you'd like to suggest a project for us to work on, open a PR adding a file following the [proposal template](project-ideas/TEMPLATE.md) for others to comment or discuss prior to the meetup and we can choose what to work on as a group. Some of these projects may warrant the creation of new repos, but we'll use this repo as a central place to gather proposals and discuss them.

Throughout the evening (if you wish) you can create subdirectories and upload the code you produce. By all means, include a README and any relevant links.
