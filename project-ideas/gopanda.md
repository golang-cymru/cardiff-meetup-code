# Proposal: GoPanda

Author(s): J Gregory (@necrophonic)

## Abstract

GoPanda - a Go driven Kanban board

## Background

Most agile-type tools generally suck and generally end up influencing working practice (tools should be chosen to support the working practice, not the other way around).

## Proposal

 GoPanda is an attempt to create a simple to use Kanban board but with some powerful features - e.g. Touch screen support / Auto-avataring onto cards etc

## Rationale

It's got a cool name. What's not to like?

## Implementation (if applicable)

Go based API/core with lightweight client UI/UX
