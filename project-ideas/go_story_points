Author(s): Rich_V

## Abstract

## Background

As part of agile planning processes, the ability for each person to submit their story point estimate in a remote team.

## Proposal

(or other algorithm) to provide an overall estimate.

## Rationale

Errrr. Cos it would be good...?

## Implementation (if applicable)

  * Remote console apps, connecting via gRPC.
  * Central "server" sends out and collates the scores.
  * Provides a web interface for results?
