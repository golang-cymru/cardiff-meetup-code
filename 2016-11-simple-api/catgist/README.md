# Cat Gist

Our team decided we would:
 
* Set up a web server that would:
    * get a picture from the Cat api
    * Convert it to ascii
    * Upload it to github as an anonymous gist
    * redirect the user to one of the above gists on every request
 
* _Gist code based on: https://gist.github.com/minikomi/2861097_
* _Ascii code based on: https://github.com/stdupp/goasciiart_
