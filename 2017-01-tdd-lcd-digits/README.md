# LCD Digits

We set out as a group to tackle on of the problems listed on [cyber-dojo](http://cyber-dojo.org/) using a TDD approach. We chose the LCD Digits problem.

We started with a method that could return a single 'LCD' digit, and expanded on it to return any single digit and eventually multiple digits.

We took turns writing unit tests, implementing functionality, and refactoring.
